        <p> KFC have perfect and many strategies planning for their growth. They introduce variety menu, desert menu and buffet to restaurant. They are aiming particular foods for certain area and they are trying to open small food count all over the area for their sales. They open small food count around hospital, university, stadium, shopping mall and airports.

            They are trying to focus on customer satisfaction. So they are more customers friendly and faster so they can attract more customers in their sales. They are giving food which is healthier than others and they are offering some sort of promotion so these sort strategies are using for their growth
            
            KFC-J, with its partner Mitsubisi, it is strongly placed to Japan, and growth can proceed. It is necessary to observe of any new participants, but more attention should be turned on KTTHK.
            
            KTTHK – the various markets, but all – economic tigers with market segments to which KFC would address more from the firm point of view (fashion) than price prospect (fast food – not always the cheapest source of meal in foreign markets). Certain people in these markets could be indignant potentially at a Japanese head (Ohkawara) the American chain, entering into the market considering stories of the countries with Japan, thus, from the political point of view having Mayer, proceed within a year, or two it could be longer better from the point of view of public relation. Besides, as it was with KFC so long with a good track record, despite its lacks he is still valuable manager to keep. Mayer could find more politically convenient ways to inform requirement in KTTHK to show results, probably to spend some time personally with Uestonom in these countries and development of the strategic plan in a tandem so that Ueston felt that it is connected with the new plan. Purchase of having management – in in critical in relation to successful performance of strategy.
            
            In addition, essential investigation of a site is important for Seoul, Bangkok, and Island/kouluna HK, as the basic marketing of a fast food (a product, the price, the PLACE, encouragement), requirement – high movement, fashionable trading area with a considerable quantity of young buyers. Probably Mayer could go on some boy scouts of a site w. All four of these city markets have a rich delivery of new repeated clients, in addition to tourist dollars. The site is key for expansion KFC in these areas with certain researches to and to young transport samples of workers of office/retail of students. The reference to their tastes is less important than a site in “hot” area, as these markets – all intention of emulation to the “American” culture.
            
            I would like to see KFC, and all other establishments of fast food do the food information accessible to clients. Advanced in years that I and my family traveled in these Asian countries, we saw disgustingly obvious, fast deterioration of health of the young people (excess weight, spots). Taiwan and Hong Kong especially are guided by formation, thus, everyone in general considers these establishments as the filled students who chew on fast food, studying their plentiful homework. Business profitableness – good, responsible business and profitableness is better.
            
            BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT OF KFC
            MACRO ENVIRONMENT
            
            Macro environment of KFC analyze by PESTEL analysis, which are political, economical, social, technological, environmental and legal
            
            PESTEL ANALYSIS
            Political
            
            The operations of KFC are affected by the government policies on the
            
            regulations of fast food operation. Currently world countries government are controlling the
            
            marketing of fast food restaurant because of health concern such as
            
            cardiovascular and cholesterol issue and obesity among the young and
            
            children in the country. Governments also control the license given for open
            
            the fast food restaurant and other business regulation need to follow such as
            
            for a franchise business. Good relationship with government in giving
            
            mutual benefits such as employment and tax is a must for the company to
            
            succeed in any foreign market. KFC is caring about animal rights and they are issuing labeled food product as government order.
            
            Economic
            
            Though for last 1 year there was economic slowdown all across the globe but the sales of KFC and other fast food chains did not slow down to that extent
            
            that of other sectors in. The GDP (Purchasing Power Parity) is estimated at
            
            2.965 trillion U.S. dollars in the year 2010. The GDP- per Capita (PPP) was
            
            2700 U.S. dollars as estimated in 2008. The GDP- real growth rate in 2007
            
            was 8.7%. India has the third highest GDP in terms of purchasing power
            
            parity just ahead Japan and behind U.S. and China. They are getting support from their major suppliers so they can grow and withstand without any difficulty. They have perfect strategy so they have good strength in growing market.
            
            Socio cultural
            
            There has also been a continuous increase in the consumption of fast food in
            
            the world. The social trend toward fast good consumption is changing and UK
            
            has seen an increase of 90% fast food consumption from the year 2002-
            
            2007. This increase is far greater than the increase in the BRIC nations of
            
            Brazil (20 per cent), Russia (50 per cent) and China (almost 60 per cent).
            
            Thus this shows a positive trend for fast food industries in UK.
            
            Technological:
            
            The UK fast food Industry is heating up with a lot of foreign players
            
            entering the Indian market. The technological knowhow and expertise will
            
            also enter the Indian market with an increase in competition. With the lower
            
            rates and increase technology the fast food counters are attracting youth by
            
            giving them attractive deals. For e.g. KFC and </p>
